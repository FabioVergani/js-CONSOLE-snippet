If the demo uses lot of calls to the canvas drawing functions, this method reduce all the name methods to short calls, reducing the overall chars usage. In some cases, a modified version of the hash can be used:

for($ in a)a[$[0]+$[6]]=a[$];
But test it carefully in all browsers. This one has a more limited function selection, with different performance in each browser.

Setting canvas width/height also clears it
c.width=c.height=o;
...
c.clearRect(0,0,o,o);   // inside animation loop
...                     // before

...
c.width=c.height=o;     // inside animation loop
...                     // after
This saves one complete sentence if the demo has animation with clearing the canvas on every frame.
